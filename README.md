A Majora's Mask Randomizer item tracker. 
Written in actionscript 3 with flashpunk, slightly modified with SHiLLySiT's input.as for right click support.

You can either just run the .swf in a browser (not that any browser support flash anymore), standalone flash player, or just grab the bundled flash projector and run the exe. 
The air version looks cleaner and has a custom icon going for it, but you'd have to have air installed.
